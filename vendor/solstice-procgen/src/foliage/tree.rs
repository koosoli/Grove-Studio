//! Trees and bushes, grown from a [`Species`] description.
//!
//! A plant is a trunk that carries levels of branches, each level spiralling around its parent at
//! the golden angle as real shoots do, and the last level carries leaves. Every stem is a tube of
//! its own, starting inside its parent as branches do in production tree models. That keeps each
//! one a separate piece, which the cluster builder can thin out with distance like a leaf.
//!
//! The crown's outline comes from how long the trunk's branches are at each height, which is how
//! species differ most at a glance: a rounded oak, a narrow birch, a wide bush. Conifers carry
//! their branches in whorls, rings of several at one height, rather than in a spiral.
//!
//! Each species names its [`Bark`] and [`LeafKind`], which decide both the textures to use and
//! the outline each leaf is built with.
