//! Bark, as surfaces of the procedural library.
//!
//! Each bark is listed in [`surfaces`](crate::surfaces) by name, so a scene can ask for
//! `birch_bark 2` like any other material. Bark wraps around stems, so every one repeats a whole
//! number of times across its tile: [`AROUND`] times, every [`BARK_REPEAT`] metres. Features
//! across a bark are built at that repeat, which keeps its seam invisible on every stem.
//!
//! Each is modelled on photographs of the real bark, by its structure first: what the ridges,
//! plates and markings are, how big, and which way they run. Colour then follows that shape.
