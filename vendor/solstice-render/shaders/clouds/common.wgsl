// The cloud model and its ray march, shared by every cloud pass.

// Clouds fill a shell above a curved planet, between `clouds.base` and `clouds.top`. Their
// density follows Schneider's method (Horizon: Zero Dawn, 2015), as Unreal's volumetric clouds
// also do: a weather map says where cloud can form and of what kind; a height profile for that
// kind gives the outline from flat base to rounded or anvil top; Perlin-Worley noise carves
// that into puffs; and Worley noise erodes their edges into wisps and cauliflower billows.
// Lighting follows Hillaire's "Physically Based Sky, Atmosphere and Cloud Rendering in
// Frostbite" (2016): a short march towards the sun for self-shadowing, a dual-lobe phase
// function, and multiple scattering approximated by octaves of weaker, broader, deeper light.
