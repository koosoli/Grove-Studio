// How water changes a surface's material (docs/wetness.md).
//
// Water wets a surface in two stages (Lagarde 2013, "Water drop 2: wet surfaces").
//   1. It fills the pores of a porous surface: sand, soil, rough stone. Water in the pores lowers
//      the contrast of refractive index between grains and what surrounds them, so light goes
//      deeper and more is absorbed: the surface darkens and its colour deepens (Lekner and Dorf
//      1988). Measured wet sands and soils reflect about half what they do dry (Twomey, Bohren
//      and Mergenthaler 1986). The surface turns a little smoother too.
//   2. Once the pores are full, or at once on a surface with none, such as paint or metal, a
//      film forms on top. It is smooth, so the surface turns glossy; on ground facing up it
//      fills the hollows, and the fine bumps drown under its flat top.
//
// The including shader declares `frame: Frame` and, for where the water has been,
// `waterline: WaterlineParams` and `waterline_map: texture_2d<f32>` (ocean/waterline.rs).

#include "ocean/waterline_params.wgsl"

// A soaked porous surface's albedo is its dry albedo raised to this power: between 1, dry, and
// 2, the limit Lekner and Dorf give for a highly porous one. Sand of albedo 0.35 comes out at
// about half, as measured; darker channels lose a larger share, so colours deepen.
