//! Virtualized geometry: per-view LOD selection, culling and rasterization.
//!
//! Each frame the main view runs two occlusion phases:
//!
//! ```text
//!  cull (old depth) -> raster -> build depth pyramid
//!  cull (retries against new depth) -> raster -> build depth pyramid
//!  resolve visibility buffer to G-buffer
//! ```
//!
//! Other views (shadow cascades, GI voxelization) reuse the same culling with their
//! own [`PassView`], without occlusion and with hardware rasterization only.
