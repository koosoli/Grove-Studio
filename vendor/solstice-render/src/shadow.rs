//! Cascaded sun shadow maps, drawn through the same cluster culling as the main view.
//!
//! Shadow maps are the most expensive pass on small GPUs, and most of a scene stands still, so
//! a cascade holds only static instances and is only redrawn when its view changes. Views move
//! in coarse steps to make that rare: each cascade covers slightly more than it must, so it can
//! stay put while the camera moves. When several cascades are stale, the far ones take turns.
//!
//! Movable instances are drawn every frame into a map of their own, through the same view as
//! the cascade they fall in, and shading multiplies the light the two let through. The four
//! cascades share
//! one more layer of the array for this, a quarter each, at half their resolution: a moving
//! thing's shadow is a little softer, but it costs one layer rather than four, and no new
//! binding. Shaders that sample the shadows are already at WebGPU's limit of 16 textures. A
//! cascade with nothing movable in it draws nothing, and is not sampled twice.
