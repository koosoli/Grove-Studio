//! The seabed under the sea: a map of the scene seen from straight above, which tells the water
//! how deep it is everywhere around the camera.
//!
//! Waves feel the bottom. As the water shoals they stand up and break, and no crest stands taller
//! than the water beneath it can hold. Over dry land there are no waves at all. The water layer
//! reads this map to shrink its waves in the shallows (`ocean/seabed.wgsl`), so the sea meets
//! the shore along its calm waterline rather than cutting through the sand wherever a crest
//! happens to rise, and it never surfaces in hollows inland, however low the land.
//!
//! The map is drawn by the shadow maps' depth-only pass through the same cluster culling, from a
//! little above the sea: decks, cliff tops and anything else high above the water are cut away,
//! so it is what lies under the water that counts. The scene is static, so the map is redrawn
//! only when the camera has moved a long way, the sea's level has changed, or finer geometry has
//! streamed in.
